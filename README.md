# state-data

Assigned project I created for an introduction to programming course at Michigan State University <br />

Students are required to: 
<ul>
  <li>continuously ask the user to input a file until a valid name is entered </li>
  <li>read the content of the file while storing data in a data structure </li>
  <li>display extreme values (maximum and minimum) for the GDP per capita and Per capita income of each state in the chosen region </li>
  <li>allow the user to choose two valid economic values (as x and y) to plot data points </li>
  <li>draw a linear regression line on the plot based on the data points </li>
 </ul>
State_Data.py contains my implementation of the project <br />
State_Data.csv contains the economic data for each U.S. state <br />
