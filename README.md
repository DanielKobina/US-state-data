# state-data

Assigned project I created for an introduction to programming course at Michigan State University <br />
Students are required to: <br />
  -continuously ask the user to input a file until a valid name is entered
  -read the content of the file while storing data in a data structure
  -display extreme values (max and minimum) for the GDP per capita and Per capita income of each state in the chosen region
  -allow the user to choose two valid economic values (as x and y) to plot data points
  -draw a linear regression line on the plot based on the data points
  
State_Data.py contains my implementation of the project
State_Data.csv contains the economic data for each U.S. state

Examples below:
